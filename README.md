# DIY-Stream-Deck-Alternative-with-LuaMacros-Multi-Layer-Macro-Setup

Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹
I've been working on a project to turn a secondary keyboard into a DIY stream deck using LuaMacros, with support for multiple layers/pagesâ€”a feature I noticed is often missing in similar projects. Each layer acts as a "profile" for different macros, and you can switch between them using specific keys (e.g., Left Ctrl to go left, Left Alt to go right). The script is flexible and highly customizable!

The only caveat is that it doesn't have a GUI, so you'll need to modify the code yourself. However, the comments in the script make it easier to understand and tweak for your needs.

Features:
Multi-layer support: Think of each layer as a profile for custom macros, switchable via dedicated keys (Left Ctrl and Left Alt).
Keyboard ID assignment: Avoid configuring the keyboard every time by directly setting its ID in the script.
Cost-effective solution: No need for expensive hardware like a stream deckâ€”just repurpose an old keyboard!
Why itâ€™s cool:
While it lacks the GUI of a traditional stream deck, it offers similar functionality for those who prefer a keyboard-first workflow. Itâ€™s perfect for gamers, programmers, or anyone who loves automation.

If you're interested, feel free to try it out and let me know your thoughts! I'm also open to suggestions for improving the script or adding new features.
